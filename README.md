# Pastebin-Lite
Pastebin-Lite is a lightweight web application that allows users to create and share text pastes through unique URLs. Each paste can optionally be configured with time-based expiration (TTL) and/or a maximum view limit. Once any configured constraint is exceeded, the paste becomes unavailable and returns a 404 response.
